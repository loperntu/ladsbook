- **Multidimensional scaling**

    * Multidimensional scaling takes a table of similarities among words and turns it into a visual display like a map showing distances among words.And you can use a diagram called **word cloud** to display the results.

    * Extending word clouds with covers: 
Drawing boundaries around groups of words is one way to get some of this information. These boundaries are called **covers**. Covers surround the places in the chart where similar words congregate together.(Stuhl, 2015)
