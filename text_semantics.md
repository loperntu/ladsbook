# 文本語意與統計學


## 文本統計

text analytics 涉及到的統計技術，主要是 **描述分析** (descriptive analysis) 與 **推論分析** (predictive analysis)。

> Descriptive analytics makes up a very large part of text analytics. These methods show broad patterns, count items, or shows what is near another item. This form of analytics does not show what influences an outcome and by how much. The business of predictive analytics, however, is doing just that – showing what leads to a change in some target variable, such as liking, preference or behaviour, and how strong those influences are likely to be.

> Treating words as vectors means that we are ignoring the order of the words and the meanings that they might take from the words around them. This may seem like a great deal to disregard, but in the more advanced forms of analysis, and in particular predictive analytical methods, the ways words are present (and absent) alone can give us a great deal of information, and allow us to build powerful models that can forecast or predict liking, preference and even behaviour.(Stuhl, 2015)
