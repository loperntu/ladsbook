> Treating words as vectors means that we are ignoring the order of the words and the meanings that they might take from the words around them. This may seem like a great deal to disregard, but in the more advanced forms of analysis, and in particular predictive analytical methods, the ways words are present (and absent) alone can give us a great deal of information, and allow us to build powerful models that can forecast or predict liking, preference and even behaviour.(Stuhl, 2015)
