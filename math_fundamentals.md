## 統計

基本概念

- 顯著 (statistical significance)

> Statistical significance is often mentioned, but its meaning is not well understood. When a result is significant, it means you are very confident that you are not making a false claim.* Significance does not measure how likely you are to be missing something real, which is determined by the much less-used statistical power.
