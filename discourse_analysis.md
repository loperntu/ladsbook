# Discourse analysis




* Effective discourse is characterized by clear relations between sentences and coherent structure.
* Due to text variants, it is hard to signal them. So we need to **annotate** discourse information on written/spoken texts.
* Different **annotation frameworks** have been proposed.
(e.g., `Penn Discourse Treebank`, `RST Discourse Treebank`).
