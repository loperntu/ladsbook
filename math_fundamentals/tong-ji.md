# 統計

## 基本概念



* 相關 \(correlation\)







* 顯著 \(statistical significance\)

> Statistical significance is often mentioned, but its meaning is not well understood. When a result is significant, it means you are very confident that you are not making a false claim.\* Significance does not measure how likely you are to be missing something real, which is determined by the much less-used statistical power.\(Stuhl, 2015\)
